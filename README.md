<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![](Images/3rd%20SS.png)

There are many great ticketing airline systems around but nothing like Koala Airlines! As my final programming fundamentals project, the code was six months in the making primarily because it is the application of all the things that we were taught in lecture and tutorial sessions. 

Some of the project requirements (specified by the tutor):
* Names should be only accepted with letters and no numbers
* A display table for the final passengers with unique seat numbers and ID
* Passengers whose last names exceed 5 letters are to be trimmed
* Max seats are 40
* Many more constraints but I'm too lazy to type 

The finals was very enjoyable and although I made other C# projects before, this one takes the cake for its challenges.
